# Chapter One - Hands-on Machine Learning withScikit-Learn, Keras, andTensorFlow

## The Machine Learning Landscape

### In this chapter we have covered some of the most important concepts in MachineLearning. In the next chapters we will dive deeper and write more code, but before wedo, make sure you know how to answer the following questions:

---

### 1. How would you define Machine Learning?
* Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they canlearn from data.

### 2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?
* Identify people.
* Filtering mails as spam.
* Make predictions from a set of values.
* Recognition.

### 3. What is a labeled training set?
* It is a set of desired solutions for the algorithm.

### 4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?
* Classification.
* Target numeric value.

### 5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
* Dimensionality reduction.
* Anomaly detection.
* Novelty detection.
* Asocciation rule learning.

### 6. What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot towalk in various unknown terrains?
* Reinforcement learning.

### 7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiplegroups?
* Model-based learning.

### 8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?
* Supervised learning problem.

### 9. What is an online learning system?
* The system trains incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially, either individually or by small groups called mini-batches.

### 10. What is out-of-core learning?
* It is when the system trains on huge datasets that cannot fit in one machine's main memory.

### 11. What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?
* Learning algorithm that relies on a similarity measure to make predictions is instance-based algorithm.

### 12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithmâ€™s hyperparameter?
* The difference is: model parameters are estimated from data automatically and model hyperparameters are set manually and are used in processes to help estimate model parameters. Model hyperparameters are often referred to as parameters because they are the parts of the machine learning that must be set manually and tuned.

### 13. What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?
* The model-based learning algorithms need a optimal value of the parameters to generalize the model. The most common strategy is minimizing the loss & accuracy or regularization. A model can then be able to make predictions using the set parameters.

### 14. Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?
* Overfitting the Data.
* Underfitting the Data.
* Insufficient Data.
* Poor Quality Data.

### 15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to newinstances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?
* Get more data.
* Implement a simpler model.
* Eliminate outliers or noise from the existing data set.

### 16. What is a test set and why would you want to use it?
* Test set is a set that you use to test your model and to see how it perfoms. Test set can helps you to determinate how good or bad is your model perform.

### 17. What is the purpose of a validation set?
* Validation set is a set to compare between different training models.

### 18. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?
* If you tune hyperparameter using the test sets, then it may not perform well on the out-of-sample data because the model is tuned just for a specific set.

### 19. What is repeated cross-validation and why would you prefer it to using a singlevalidation set?
* Cross-validation is a tood to compare models without needing a separate validation set. It is preferred over validation set because we can save from the breaking of part of the training set to create a validation set, as having more data is valuable regardless.
